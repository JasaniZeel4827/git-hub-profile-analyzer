## API Routes (Internal)
These routes proxy GitHubâ€™s REST API and are used by the client.

- `GET /api/github/user/[username]`
  - Proxies `GET https://api.github.com/users/[username]`
  - Returns the GitHub user profile JSON

- `GET /api/github/repos/[username]`
  - Proxies `GET https://api.github.com/users/[username]/repos?per_page=100&sort=updated&direction=desc`
  - Returns up to 100 repos (sorted by last update) for analytics

Notes:
- Calls include headers `Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json` and a `User-Agent` string.
- These endpoints do not use authentication by default; unauthenticated GitHub API requests are rate-limited (typically 60 requests/hour per IP). See Troubleshooting below.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ recommended
- pnpm (preferred) or npm/yarn

### Install
```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

### Run Dev Server
```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```
Then open `http://localhost:3000`.

### Build and Start (Production)
```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
# or
npm run build
npm start
```

## Usage
1. Open the app and enter a GitHub username (e.g., `vercel`, `torvalds`).
2. Submit to fetch the profile and repositories.
3. Explore the analytics panel for stars, languages, top repos, and account age.
4. Click a repo or the profile link to open it on GitHub.
5. Reuse recent searches via the badges under the search bar.

## Customization Tips
- UI theming is handled via shadcn/ui + Tailwind. Update styles in `app/globals.css` or component classes.
- Analytics logic is computed in `app/page.tsx` after repos are fetched. Extend it to add metrics like average stars per repo, forks, issues, commit activity (requires additional endpoints), etc.
- `components/profile-analytics.tsx` is the place to modify analytics visualizations.
